It requires you to make calls directly to EAS API. You can find specifications, request structure, samples of code in most programming languages on the Developer Portal.</p> <p>For example, to get a list of incoming documents using this method, you will have to send a <code>GET</code> request to the specific URL and handle resulting response in json format. This can be done in any programming language, or even with a batch script using curl. Thus, it is possible to create a batch/shell script and configure it to run every few hours using Windows Task Scheduler or a cron job.</p> <p>This method requires you to attach a few security related headers and specify a client certificate file. But, encryption, decryption and signing of the documents is handled on the server side. So, EAS API will expect you to send and receive documents in clear text. All messages will still be encrypted and validated (https, subscription keys, client certificates), but there will be no end to end encryption of the document payload.</p>"},{"location":"How-To-Connect/#2-connecting-via-the-eas-client","title":"2.
